## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PuspenduNayak/AIWeatherApplication
   cd YOUR_REPO
   ```

2. **Create** `config.js` **from** `config.example.js`**:**

   - Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`:

     ```bash
     cp config.example.js config.js
     ```
   - Open `config.js` and replace the placeholder API keys:

     ```javascript
     // config.js
     const OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = "your_openweather_key";
     const GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_gemini_key";
     ```

     with your actual OpenWeather and Gemini API keys.

3. **Ensure** `.gitignore` **includes** `config.js` **to protect your keys:**

   ```
   config.js
   ```

4. **Open** `index.html` **in a browser or deploy via Vercel CLI:**

   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

🔒 **Important Notes**

- `config.js` is excluded from GitHub to keep your API keys private
- Deploy with Vercel CLI to include `config.js` securely
- Keys are exposed to client — do not use for sensitive data
